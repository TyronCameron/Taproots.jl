Taproots.setdata! is also easy to implement – because it doesn't matter if your type is mutable or immutable. You can modify it (and then return the node) if it's mutable. If immutable, just return a newly created node with modified data.Taproots.setchildren! can sometimes be a bit trickier to implement – it requires us to actually mutate the way we get children.Remember that at any stage you can check whether your Taproots.data and Taproots.setdata! work just by calling them on each other. E.g. setdata!(taproot, data(taproot)) needs to look the same as the original taproot.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Index","title":"Index","text":"Now we get the good stuff.
