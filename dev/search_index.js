Obviously you can just collect that into a vector if you prefer (and you don't need the laziness benefits).\n\nmy_data_in_a_vec = my_data |> postorder |> collect\nprintln(my_data_in_a_vec)\n\n\nIterators.filter(x -> x isa String, leaves(my_data)) |> first # gives us the only string in the data structure ... \"I don't even need to stick to one type ... but obviously a string has no children\"\n\nPackages like this one are nice but you may be worried about interoperability with other (potentially more expansive) packages. So to make it all work out plainly, you can grab an adjacency matrix of your taproot whenever you want.\n\nadjacencymatrix(my_data) # gives us an adjacency matrix of 1s and 0s\n\nYou are now able to shove the structure of your DAG into another graph-specific utility. But don't be too hasty; check out the cool things Taproots.jl can do first!\n\nThere are also other handy functions to help you flag certain nodes so you know what they look like in your structure:\n\nischild(potential_child, parent) # true if the potential child is recursively a child of the parent. \nisparent(potential_parent, child) # true if the potential parent is recursively a parent of the child. \nisleaf(node) # true if the node has no children\nisbranch(node) # true if the node has any children\n\nThere are handy functions to help you find nodes as well! \n\nfindtrace(matcher, my_data) # gets you an index trace of the first node for which matcher(node) evaluates to true. \nfindtrace(child, my_data) # gets you an index trace of the first node which is equal to child. \nfindtraces(matcher, my_data) # gets you every index trace of the nodes for which matcher(node) evaluates to true.\nfindtraces(child, my_data) # gets you every index trace of the nodes for which node == child. \npluck(my_data, trace; default = nothing) # follows the index down to the pits to get you back whatever is in that index spot, otherwise return `default`","category":"section"},{"location":"#Modification-of-data-and-structure","page":"Index","title":"Modification of data and structure","text":"Now there comes a time in every Taprootian's life when they yearn to modify their Taproots in place. And this is a dangerous topic because if you modify a Taproot in place, you might destroy the links to the children inadvertently. So for this purpose, you would need to add a few more functions. \n\nTaproots.data(node::MyType) = node.some_data # provide a way to get any auxiliary data (other than children) that your node might contain. Can simply return `node` or nothing at all. Doing this will unlock sinking your type to a Taproots.Taproot. \nTaproots.setdata!(node::MyType, data) = (node.some_data = data; node) # provide a way to set data in your node, if any. It can also do nothing. Once done, it must return `node`. This one as well as the next unlocks `tapmap` and variants.\nTaproots.setchildren!(node::MyType, children::Vector) = (node.children = children; node) # provide a way to set children in your node. Once done, it must return `node`. This one unlocks `prune` and variants. \n\ntip: Tip\nTaproots.data is an easy one to implement, but it's pretty useless unless you also implement the other functions. Taproots.setdata! is also easy to implement – because it doesn't matter if your type is mutable or immutable. You can modify it (and then return the node) if it's mutable. If immutable, just return a newly created node with modified data.Taproots.setchildren! can sometimes be a bit trickier to implement – it requires us to actually mutate the way we get children.Remember that at any stage you can check whether your Taproots.data and Taproots.setdata! work just by calling them on each other. E.g. setdata!(taproot, data(taproot)) needs to look the same as the original taproot.\n\nNow we get the good stuff. We can map every node's data while keeping the structure sparkly. \n\ntapmap(x -> x isa String ? uppercase(x) : x, my_data) \n\nThis gives us something like this: \n\nMyType(\"THE ROOT\", [\n\tMyType(\"SOME OTHER DATA\", []),\n\tMyType(\"I CAN NEST DATA HERE\", [\n\t\tMyType(\"SUCH NESTED, MUCH WOW\", [])\n\t]),\n\t\"I DON'T EVEN NEED TO STICK TO ONE TYPE ... BUT OBVIOUSLY A STRING HAS NO CHILDREN\",\n\tDict(\n\t\t:x => \"TAPROOTS.CHILDREN IS ALREADY IMPLEMENTED ON DICTS\",\n\t\t:y => :(\"AS WELL AS \" * \" OTHER TYPES\")\n\t)\n])\n\nwarning: Warning\nx comes straight from Taproots.data(node). x itself is not a node, and as such the strings inside MyType also get converted. Very awesome, but be careful! If you prefer changing the entire nodes themselves, then: 1) ensure Taproots.data(node::MyType) = node; or 2) use the regular iterators such as postorder(node) which returns entire nodes.\n\nWe can also get rid of all the nodes we don't like (... except the root, topmost node. Prune won't get rid of that one, and for good reason.)\n\nprune(x -> x isa MyType, my_data) # keep only the nodes which are MyTypes\n\nThere are similar handy functions such as:\n\ntapmap!(f, taprootius) # modify all nodes in place\ntapmap(f, taprootius) # deepcopy and then modify all nodes in place\n\ntapmapif!(condition, f, taprootius) # modify nodes in place if they satisfy `condition`. Very handy if your tree has multiple different types. \ntapmapif(condition, f, taprootius) # deepcopy and then modify nodes in place if they satisfy `condition`. Very handy if your tree has multiple different types. \n\nleafmap!(f, taprootius) # modify all leaves in place\nleafmap(f, taprootius) # deepcopy and then modify all leaves in place\n\nbranchmap!(f, taprootius) # modify all branches in place\nbranchmap(f, taprootius) # deepcopy and then modify all branches in place\n\nprune!(f, taprootius) # get rid of children which do not satisfy f in place\nprune(f, taprootius) # deepcopy and then get rid of children which do not satisfy f in place\n\nleafprune!(f, taprootius) # get rid of leaves which do not satisfy f in place\nleafprune(f, taprootius) # deepcopy and then get rid of leaves which do not satisfy f in place\n\nbranchprune!(f, taprootius) # get rid of branches which do not satisfy f in place\nbranchprune(f, taprootius) # deepcopy and then get rid of branches which do not satisfy f in place\n\nYou also get other handy functions by implementing those functions:\n\ngraft!(taproot, trace, node) # Where `pluck` is get, this is set. This sets the trace to `node`. Only grafts that one trace, not other traces (which might lead to the same node)\nuproot!(root, child) # pluck out `child` and ALL its parents. Then reverse the directions of the arrows. This is the only way to reverse arrows in `Taproots.jl`\n\ntip: Tip\nMy suggestion would be to try create a Base.copy implementation for your type if it's not obvious and not simply constructed from a constructor of its fields.  We use Base.copy if it's available when doing all the non-modifying variants of the functions above.

You can use this to store data if you couldn't be bothered with nesting things in your own struct. Taproots, however, don't allow arbitrary children types.\n\nTaproot(data::Any, children::Vector{Taproot})\n\nAlternatively, you can convert your type to a Taproots.Taproot. \n\ntaprootius = tapin(my_data)\n\nYou can get back out again simply by providing some kind of sink. \n\nback_to_the_future = tapout((data, children) -> MyType(data, children), taprootius)\n\nIn the example above, the children will automatically be coverted to MyType because the sink function we provided gets called recursively. \n\nTaproots.jl also treats many base types like Dict, Vector, and Expr as taproots, and all other types as leaves. So you can do something like this \n\ndict = Dict(\n\t\t:a => Dict(\n\t\t\t:b => \"nonsense_data\",\n\t\t\t:c => \"more_data\",\n\t\t),\n\t\t:d => \"final_data\"\n\t)\nleafmap!(uppercase, dict)\n\nHere's another usecase: metaprogramming. \n\nnums = 1:100\nexpr = :(append!(map(x -> sqrt(x) == floor(sqrt(x)), nums), map(x -> x^(1/3) == floor(x^(1/3)), nums)) |> unique!)\nleafmap!(x -> x == :map ? :filter : x, expr)\neval(expr)\n\nThis last bit here is absolute raw power.
